Lua0
====

zero-based Fork of Lua.

Goal
----
It will consist on nothing but patch files to make the core library work
with zero based indexes. And minimal build scripts. Ideally after
handling versions officially released by upstream, and applying the
patches, the upstream build scripts should be used.

Features / To-do list
=====================

[ ] Map initial work and necessary API changes
   [ ] TODO:
[X] Fetch Lua versions
[ ] Apply zero-based patches
[ ] Apply "branding" (i.e. call everything lua0) patches (hopefully work across multiple versions?)
[ ] Build Lua0 using upstream scripts
